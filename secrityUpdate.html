            <b>T</b>oday’s the first Monday of June 2021, which means it’s time for a new Android Security Bulletin to go live. Right on schedule, Google has published the June 2021 Android Security Bulletin. They’ve also started rolling out new updates to currently supported Pixel phones, though as a bonus, the latest update to Pixel phones also brings the latest Pixel Feature Drop.

               The Android Security Bulletin for the month of June 2021, which can be viewed here, details multiple security vulnerabilities ranging in severity from high to critical. As we’ve seen in the past, many of the disclosed vulnerabilities don’t offer additional documentation that explains what is affected and how the patch addresses the issue. You can read up on how monthly Android security updates work here.
